NoTrace
This is an idea, Im looking for unexplored ways to help connect and organize
groups of people for beach and ocean conservation. The goal for the future
is to maintain cleaner ways of living all the while still being able to enjoy
nature. Teaching people to be more conscientious when roaming the world and leaving
NoTrace while doing so.
